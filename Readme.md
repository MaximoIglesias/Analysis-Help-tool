This proyect was created to ease the process of creating the functional analysis of the changes made to our ERP software and keeping an up to date reference to the fields and function of every screen of the system.
Since the changes are made through an internal tasks soft based upon incidents, the main reference key is the incident number.
It was also designed to maintain a wiki like screen reference and help documentation of the soft by creating the wiki page and exporting the articles to the internal wiki.
Originaly all documentation was kept on word documents so it also has a tool to import those documents by using the heading types and the character bold or normal styles to tell appart the different sections of the documents.
It also allows to create use cases by indicating the steps referencing the controls order, actions and parameters.
